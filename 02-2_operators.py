# OPERATORS


# Arithmetic operators

a = 5
b = 10

print("The value of 5 + 10 is ", a+b)
print("The value of 5 - 10 is ", a-b)
print("The value of 5 * 10 is ", a*b)
print("The value of 5 / 10 is ", a/b)

# Assignment operator

a = 34
print(a)

a += 2
print(a)

a -= 2
print(a)

a *= 2
print(a)

a /= 2
print(a)

# Comparison Operators

b = (4 > 7)  # >>returns boolean
print(b)
b = (4 < 7)  # >>returns boolean
print(b)
b = (4 == 7)  # >>returns boolean
print(b)
b = (4 != 7)  # >>returns boolean
print(b)


# Logical operators

bool1 = True
bool2 = False

print("Logical and => ", bool1 and bool2)
print("Logical or => ", bool1 or bool2)
print("Logical not => ", not bool1)
